# Mine-Landingpage
I am creating a portfolio landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills and projects while enhancing my web development knowledge. This project allows me to practice front-end design, improve coding proficiency, and build an engaging personal portfolio to highlight my growth as a developer.
